Falafel Salam’s Locations and Map Page Design Concepts

I will most likely be using Helvetica as my font. The major colors I will be using are green, black, and white. I may also be using purple and some sort of wood color.I have not fully decided on the graphical elements yet I am looking for elements that will give the business a clean,neat and modern look while adhering to the company’s organic, farm-farm-to-table ideology and product. 

The current mock ups I have created are for a large screen and for and for mobile. I have not yet added any graphical elements and the colors are not set in stone either. I am also adding a mock-up of the header design. The header is not something I plan on creating for this course but since it is relevant and I already did the work I figured I would add the file.
